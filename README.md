# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Anomaly-Detection
Developed an unsupervised fraud detection model using Isolation Forest on anonymized transaction data and evaluated performance using precision.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using an unsupervised machine learning approach. Fraud detection is a challenging problem because fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to normal ones, and labeled data is often limited. To address this, I used Isolation Forest, an anomaly detection algorithm that identifies unusual patterns in transaction behavior without relying on class labels during training.

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available, anonymized credit card transaction dataset containing 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 are fraudulent. The data includes numerical features such as transaction time, amount, and PCA-transformed variables that preserve user privacy. Since the dataset contains no missing values and all features are numeric, the preprocessing step mainly involved standardizing the data to ensure fair feature scaling before modeling.

After preprocessing, the Isolation Forest model was trained to detect anomalous transactions that could potentially represent fraud. The contamination parameter was set based on the known proportion of fraudulent transactions in the dataset. Once predictions were generated, anomaly labels were converted into binary fraud indicators, and model performance was evaluated using precision. Precision was chosen as the evaluation metric because, in real-world fraud detection systems, it is important to minimize false positives so that genuine customers are not unnecessarily flagged.

The model identified 485 transactions as suspicious, with a precision score of approximately 0.26, meaning that about one in four flagged transactions was actually fraudulent. While this may seem modest at first, it is a realistic and expected outcome for an unsupervised approach applied to highly imbalanced data. In practice, such systems are often used as an initial screening step, where flagged transactions are further reviewed by analysts or downstream systems.

The final output of this project includes a complete Jupyter Notebook documenting the full workflow and a CSV file containing the detected fraud cases. This project demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world financial data to surface potential fraud, even when labeled examples are scarce.
